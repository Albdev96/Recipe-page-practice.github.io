## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned
I've learned how to put each element in the correct position with CSS and how to elaborate a semantic and proper HTML page.


### Continued development
I will keep practicing all CSS layaout properties in order to position the elements properly and easily inside the webpage, as well as to make better semantic HTML. The Media Queries is also another important thing I have to practice.
